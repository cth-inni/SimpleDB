SimpleDB
========

Folder Schema:

PROJECT ROOT<br />
    models
        Simple_DB.php
    json
        FOLDERS HERE
            FILES HERE
    
If you create the folder structure above and autoload or include this class, everything will work out of the box. 
If not, you will need to edit the constructor to tell the class where you want to store your files. The default 
location is a json folder in the project root.
